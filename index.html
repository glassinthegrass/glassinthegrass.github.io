      <h1>I'm Jared!</h1>
      <p>Currently residing in Phoenix, AZ, I'm a web developer with a love of problem solving.</p>
       <p>After many years working in various finance roles, It was pointed out to me that the happiest times of my career were when I was working on major Excel projects, learning as I went on how to best build out an Excel spreadsheet to meet our needs in creative and streamlined ways.</p>

    <!-- About Me -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="border-top">Meet Jared</h2>
      
        <p>Computers and coding have always interested me and I always wished I knew how to break into the world of software development. Well that all changed once I found <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, which has allowed me to pursue my passion and engage my dreams!</a>

        <p>Always a team player, I will ask alot of questions to pinpoint why, how and what for, each and every goal is to be met. I bring focus and creativity to every problem I am thrown.</p>

        <p>When I'm not reseaching new and interesting solutions in coding, you can find me hiking the AZ mountains <i>(Camelback is a favorite)</i>, playing video games, and pampering my two adorable puppies with my wonderful wife.</p>
