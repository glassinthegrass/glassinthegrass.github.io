      <h1>I'm Jared!</h1>
      <p>Currently residing in Phoenix, AZ, I'm a web developer with a love of problem solving.</p>
       <p>After many years working in various finance roles, It was pointed out to me that the happiest times of my career were when I was working on major Excel projects, learning as I went on how to best build out an Excel spreadsheet to meet our needs in creative and streamlined ways.</p>
